**Monique:** Making item sprites (one hat so far), working on the item class but been busy with EE Capstone.

**Payton:** Added a save detection system, made a basic README.

**Forrest:** Didnâ€™t do much. Learned more about javascript.

## Project Retrospective



* **Appreciations:** Ben implemented a load of requirements including GitHub authentication, Firebase Cloud Functions, reworks / improvements to our realtime database, the ability to create objects/sprites without making spritesheets and main refactoring.
* **Successes:** A lot of progress has been made on the project this past week (largely thanks to Ben). Things feel like they are coming together.
