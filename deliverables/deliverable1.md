## 3. Interviews summary

## Interview 1

**Interviewer:** Forrest Hartley

**Interviewee:** Sami Jurado

**When:** 09/15/2023

**Customer segment:** Computer science major, Beginner / new programmer

**Key insights:**

* Thought that gamifying code was a compelling idea
* They might like to see features supporting the ability to collect and care for multiple tamagotchi. 
* Emotive behavior was a feature that they would like to see, this might include having the tamagotchi to get angry or cry when they are neglected or an error is made.
* Thought that a walking animation for the tamagotchi might be a good idea, and mentioned that a correlation between distance walked and coding progress might be a compelling feature.

**Representative quotes:** 

* “If I was aware of this extension, I would try it out”
* “I like the idea of gamifying coding”
* “I would like to see customizability with the tamagotchi”

**Assessment (Must have / Nice to have/ Don’t care):** Nice to have

## Interview 2

**Interviewer:** Forrest Hartley

**Interviewee:** Ben Mitchell

**When:** 09/16/23

**Customer segment:** Computer science major, beginner / new programmer

**Key insights:**

* Would like the points or rewards system to be fair and not favor experienced coders over beginners.
* Would like for it to be easy to use.
* Suggested that educational features might be compelling. This could include tips or explanations when stuck on a problem.
* Would like to see customization options for the pets appearance and personality.
* Would like to see coding challenges or quests implemented

**Representative quotes:**

* “I struggle with consistency sometimes, so having a little virtual pet that rewards me for coding regularly could be motivating”
* “I wouldn't want constant pop-ups or notifications that disrupt my workflow, that would be annoying”
* “It sounds like a fun way to get custom with my coding environment”

**Assessment (Must have / Nice to have/ Don’t care):** Nice to have

## Interview 3

**Interviewer:** Noah Gooby

**Interviewee:** Micah Fennessey-Butters

**When:** 9/15/2023

**Customer segment:** Beginner-level programmer, people who need motivation to code consistently

**Key insights:**

* Thought it was interesting to “gamify” coding -- makes it more engaging
* Would likely be more motivated to code regularly, thinks he would develop skills quicker through regular practice
* Would like a variety of sprites/pets to choose from
* Would like a social aspect where they can compete with friends/others
* Would like coding challenges tailored to their skill level (LeetCode?)
* Would like regular goals/rewards
* Would NOT like if the extension is too intrusive or distracting (too many notifications)
* Would NOT like if extension has access to personal data or content of code
* Would NOT like having the pet die after a day of not coding

**Representative quotes:**

* “I would at least try it out”
* “I should be able to get my pet dripped out”
* “I’m uninstalling if he dies just because I don’t wanna code on a Saturday”

**Assessment (Must have / Nice to have/ Don’t care):** Nice to have

## Interview 4

**Interviewer:** Noah Gooby

**Interviewee:** Ethan Gooby

**When:** 9/15/2023

**Customer segment:** CS Major (Game Development), Intermediate programmer, VSCode user, someone who needs motivation to code consistently

**Key insights:**

* Would be hesitant to use for the same reason they would be hesitant to own a tamagotchi (anxiety, don’t want it to die)
* If they had friends who used it and there was a social/online interaction aspect, or leaderboard of codagotchi’s, they would be highly be incentivized to use it (from FOMO)
* Would be interested in some sort of “Challenges” integration for having coding challenges they have to pass in order to level up their codagotchi
* If there is a social aspect, there shouldn’t be a chat functionality (thinks it would be annoying).
* There should not be many notifications or pop up windows whatsoever.
* Would be interested in some microtransaction features (buying sprite skins)
* Codagotchi lore is important (even if not elaborate)

**Representative quotes:**

* “I wanna pay to win”
* “Needs continuous growth (in regards to both user base and content) or it will die”
* “You should make CodagotchiCoin”

**Assessment (Must have / Nice to have/ Don’t care):** Between don’t care and must have, but has nothing to do with being “nice to have”. It feels like a game. Would be “must have” in certain spans of time, but might die out and transition to “don’t care”.

## Interview 5

**Interviewer:** Ben Griepp

**Interviewee:** Charles Booth

**When:** 9/16/2023

**Customer segment:** Computer Science Student (Junior), VSCode User 

**Key insights:**

* Would like buying items as this would be exciting and motivating
* Would be annoyed if it resembles clippy
* Bar at the top to indicate happiness and level could be cool
* Would prefer if not too distracting
* Thinks pet dying after a week of neglect is fair
* Would prefer minimal gameplay elements
* Would like hats or any other type of cosmetics
* Would like coding challenges or leetcode integration

**Representative quotes:**

* “Hats would be really cool”
* “I would definitely use this as I could see myself being extra motivated to code or write a few more lines if I knew I was going to be able to get a cool hat”

**Assessment (Must have / Nice to have/ Don’t care):** Must Have

## Interview 6

**Interviewer:** Ben Griepp

**Interviewee:** Harshdeep Singh

**When:** 9/16

**Customer segment:** Computer Science Student (Senior), VSCode User

**Key insights:**

* Likes the concept of gamifying coding and thinks it would be motivating
* Would like some type of online interaction with others or friends
* Would like some type of evolution system possibly based off of what type of programming is done or decided by player
* Likes the idea of occasional coding challenges that give a reward if completed
* Thinks the option to receive break reminders during long coding sessions would be a nice feature
* Would not use if extension slowed down VSCode or was too distracting during coding

**Representative quotes:**

* “It’d be cool if I could choose how to evolve my pet or be based on programming languages used"
* "Constant reminders or notifications would be annoying, especially if I'm deep in concentration."
* “It’d be cool if they could smoke cigarettes”

* “For the second question have the tomogagchi like thing maybe give you some ideas of what to code if you don’t know like make a simple calculator or dice rolling system. Things to get the users ideas going.”
