## Project Retrospective

* **Successes:** Everyone is learning how to create a spritesheets/use it. Sitting together in class made communication easier. We now have a visual prototype/aid to work with ([https://codepen.io/goobyn/pen/PoXEgOW](https://codepen.io/goobyn/pen/PoXEgOW)) 
* **Failures:** See below
* **Barriers:** The way we tested sprites/animations is not completely compatible with how we’ll make our extension.
* **What to try next time:** Nothing to report

## Minutes



* Walked through Trello Board
* Ben has developed a spritesheet-reading function in svelte.
* The func. will read white/transparent as 0, black as 1.
* For now we’ll keep the sprites B&W but might do color later if we have time.
* Focus on simplicity and MVP first, then any extra fun details.
* Everyone will read the Svelte guide and familiarize themselves with it.
* Ben showed us the code files and how they’re structured.
* Noah brought up some potential changed to database work- likely going from C/C++ to TypeScript.
* Will use Node FFI to implement C++ 
* Divided workload for week 5
