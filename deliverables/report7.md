## Project Retrospective



* **Appreciations:** Everyone did well on their Midterm Presentation slides despite us going slightly over the time limit. 
* **Successes:** The project is really starting to take shape and everyone has a clear vision of where it is going.
* **Failures:** Going over the time limit for midterm presentation by 30 seconds. Slightly more preparation might have been needed.
* **Barriers:** Some members are still not fully comfortable with navigating the codebase on their own.
* **What to try next time:** Working together when adding new things to codebase.
