## Project Retrospective



* **Appreciations:** Forrest made an excellent, detailed animation of a dinosaur. Ben researched how to implement the pixel clicking system and made substantial progress on the Object class. Noah set up the Firebase database and implemented the pixel clicking system.
* **Successes:** Meeting up in person to discuss & write code seemed to be very successful.
* **Failures:** Timeliness for weekly meetings needs to be higher priority
* **Barriers:** Entering midterm season, each of us are considerably busy, makes collaboration slightly harder
* **What to try next time:** Focus on joining meeting immediately at meeting start time; may need to rediscuss meeting times

## Minutes



* Pixel clicking system implemented, a lot of progress on Object class
* We are now able to render a spritesheet and animate a sprite within the webview window -- it is also resizeable
* We have an awesome Dinosaur spritesheet
* Firebase configuration is done, we can now push any data we want to the realtime database
* Explored different OAuth options for user to connect to GitHub; may go with Firebase Authentication or explore an alternative OAuth 2 framework (such as octokit). May also host authentication through a GitHub Page and simply provide a link to the page in the extension webview window
