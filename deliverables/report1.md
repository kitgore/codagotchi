**Project idea:**

Tamagotchi Style Virtual Pet VSCode Extension: Keep a virtual pet alive within your code editor by consistently coding, if neglected for too long the pet will pass away. Likely will have a backend server allowing users to login with github to save their progress and will be developed primarily in Javascript or Typescript

**Technologies:**

**How do we plan to learn and internally disseminate knowledge about our technologies?** TypeScript / JS
- Google Firebase (realtime database)
- C++ (to link with Firebase)
- Pixel art editor (TBD); Aseprite
Will hold a meeting (Date TBD) to ensure all team members are familiar with technologies being used (namely Typescript).
