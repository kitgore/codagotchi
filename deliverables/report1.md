### Planned meeting schedule:

Every Friday at 5:00 on discord (can reschedule with week notice).

### Decision-making process:

2/3 Majority decides decisions.

### Handling non-performing team members:

If poor performance / communication / non-participation becomes an issue on more than 2 occasions, the prof will be informed. If anyone has an issue with workload / communication / anything at all, make it known in a meeting or message ASAP.

### Project idea:

Tamagotchi Style Virtual Pet VSCode Extension: Keep a virtual pet alive within your code editor by consistently coding, if neglected for too long the pet will pass away. Likely will have a backend server allowing users to login with github to save their progress and will be developed primarily in Javascript or Typescript

### Technologies:

- TypeScript / JS

- Google Firebase (realtime database)

- C++ (to link with Firebase)

- Pixel art editor (TBD); Aseprite

We will hold a meeting (Date TBD) to ensure all team members are familiar with technologies being used (namely Typescript).
