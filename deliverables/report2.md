## Project Retrospective



* **Appreciations:** Ben leading the charge on laying out general project vision, deciding which frameworks to use.
* **Successes:** We are all making progress on coming to a consensus on general project vision and which technologies to use. Discord is nice for sharing links / documents / resources.
* **Failures:** Friday meeting times might not be ideal for everyone. Working with vanilla Typescript did not work, moved to Svelte.
* **Barriers:** As mentioned above, meeting times might need to be adjusted.
* **What to try next time:** Rediscuss meeting times, see if anyone has a time that works better for them now.
