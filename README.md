# Codagotchi
The problem of irregular coding practice and lack of motivation to write code impacts a wide range of programmers, from brand-new learners to experienced developers, resulting in skill stagnation and reduced productivity. This lack of consistency hinders skill development, wastes time, and can impact software quality, incurring additional costs and missed opportunities for career growth. 

For VSCode users seeking consistent coding practice and skill improvement, Codagotchi is a free VSCode extension that gamifies learning and development, incentivizing regular coding to keep a virtual pet alive and happy. Unlike traditional learning methods, our product transforms coding into an engaging and interactive experience, fostering skill growth through motivation and rewards. Codagotchi empowers programmers to maintain consistent engagement in learning and skill development.

By transforming coding into an enjoyable experience where a virtual pet thrives through regular code-writing, Codagotchi offers a compelling incentive for programmers to stay motivated and active.
